# Database-for-House-Renting
----------------------------

In this project we have implemented an application in Microsoft Visual Studio about a House Renting platform. In this application we have created the appropriate GUI for inserts,deletes and updates of clients,employers,adds and houses in a local Database (see Database Relational Model in the DB-ANAFORA.pdf). We created certain views,triggers and 10 complex SQL queries for the user to see from the user friendly interface of our application. The DB-ANAFORA.pdf also contains the SQL commands for the creation of the Database.
We used C# for the entire project.
